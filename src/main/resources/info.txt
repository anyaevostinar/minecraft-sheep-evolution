Currently, the original sheep evolution mod folder is contained in the folder
"old_mod" and is effectively inert, as fabric.mod.json points to
evo.mixins.json rather than evolution.mixins.json. I expect we will eventually
remove that folder altogether once we incorporate their mixins into our mod,
but for the time being they remain there as a reference.
